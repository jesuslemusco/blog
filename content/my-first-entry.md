Summary: A quick hello world post using Pelican.

Welcome to my first Pelican entry!  

This is a simple blog post written in Markdown. Pelican will parse the metadata at the top and render this as an article.

- You can add **bold** or *italic* text.  
- Use lists, code blocks, images, and more.  

Example code block:

```python
print("Hello, Pelican!")
